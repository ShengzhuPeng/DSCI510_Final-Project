### My Data Pipeline

To acquire and model my data, I performed web scraping on two top-song lists, yielding 300 songs, from which track names and artist names were extracted. These were initially stored in separate CSV files, as detailed in the `billboard.py` and `netease.py` scripts, resulting in two processed files: `billboard_year_end_hot_100.csv` and `netease_music_toplist_updated.csv`.

In the main script, `main.py`, I established communication with the Spotify API to enrich my data model by converting track and artist names into unique Spotify identifiers (song_id and artist_id). This allowed me to retrieve comprehensive track details such as popularity scores, release dates, and other audio features. My data is structured in a relational database model, encompassing tables for songs, artists, and market-specific data for the U.S. and China, all managed using the SQLite library. This setup ensures that new attributes can be seamlessly integrated by adding fields to the existing tables.
