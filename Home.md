# Welcome to My Webapp!

My name is Shengzhu Peng ðŸŽ„

I'm excited to guide you through this Music Market Analysis Project ðŸŽµï½ž

### Explore Different Tabs Now! ðŸ˜†

- **Project Overview:** Dive into the aims and discoveries of this analysis, including the methodology and personal reflections.

- **Datasets:** Curious about the data behind the scenes? The 'Datasets' tab offers thorough documentation of the sources, alongside an in-depth look at the data pipeline process. This section also allows you to delve into the relational database I created.

- **Analysis & Visualization:** Ready to interact with the data? The 'Analysis & Visualization' tab showcases the heart of this comparative analysis. Engage with dynamic visualizations and uncover the nuanced insights drawn from the music markets of both countries.

> **Note:** To streamline the visualization process on the webapp, I mainly utilized two CSV files exported from my database, rather than interacting directly with the database itself. This approach simplified the visualization process, but a direct integration with the database could enhance real-time data interaction and is an area for future improvement.

**Enjoy your Journey through the beats and bytes of music analytics!**
